# Happy Numbers

This is a small java application that can be used to find happy numbers in all
sort of bases. The application would additionally generate nice tree graphs.


## Example

The following png image is an example of the output for all two digit numbers in base 10 (that is from 10 to 99).

![Example image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adriansuter/HappyNumbers/master/examples/happy_10.png)

The corresponding happy numbers are
```
10, 13, 19, 23, 28, 31, 32, 44, 49, 68, 70, 79, 82, 86, 91, 94, 97
```

## Dependencies

To generate the graphs, you need to have GraphViz installed. http://www.graphviz.org/


## IDE

The files in this repository are optimized to be used in the NetBeans IDE.


## How to run

Once compiled, you can run the jar file as usual. But you have to make sure, that in the working directory there is the `config.xml` file.
